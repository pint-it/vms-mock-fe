00:00.050 --> 00:05.050
<silence>

00:06.150 --> 00:07.170
VA Academy.

00:08.140 --> 00:12.570
This is chingo uploaded vtt file.

00:12.860 --> 00:14.410
Today we're gonna focus on the smash.

00:14.650 --> 00:19.690
I already did the backhand smash, uh, tutorial, and if you haven't watched that one, I'll link to it.

00:19.690 --> 00:22.730
However, today we're gonna focus on the hard, uh, smash.

00:23.270 --> 00:24.770
I'm not gonna do the jump smash today.

00:25.190 --> 00:28.170
I'm mainly gonna focus on just generating power with the smash.

00:32.030 --> 00:42.570
What's really important for me is that when I, when the shot, uh, when the shuttle is coming, I try to prepare, uh, as quick as possible, get my elbow back and high.

00:43.110 --> 00:46.290
And what I like to imagine is to see my body as a bow.

00:46.310 --> 00:53.290
Uh, I touch on this subject on another, um, VA academy, uh, film, which I did, uh, in my garden during the Corona lockdown.

00:53.430 --> 00:56.130
Um, however, it's, it's easier to explain here.

00:56.570 --> 01:09.290
I try to imagine myself as having a body of a bow, sort of where I try to here prepare, and then as the shuttle comes, I'm driving my elbow forward like this, and the arm.

01:10.170 --> 01:13.050
I don't wanna do too much of this with the elbow.

01:13.630 --> 01:17.370
I'd rather want to get up here high and then generate the power from there.

01:18.150 --> 01:19.450
So, uh, no more talking.

01:19.900 --> 01:23.690
We're gonna try to smash and, uh, we'll see how much power I can generate up.

01:24.920 --> 01:29.090
It's, and as you can hear, the sound is good.

01:31.450 --> 01:34.250
I wanna be as relaxed as possible when the shuttle is coming.

01:34.630 --> 01:39.610
And as, as I prepare, I don't want to be too tense because then you're not able to generate the power you want.

01:39.790 --> 01:40.810
So stay relaxed.

01:41.680 --> 01:46.970
Your arm has to stay relaxed and just when the shuttle is approaching, you're generating the power.

01:47.300 --> 01:47.770
We'll see.

01:48.390 --> 01:48.610
Woo.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.090
What do England

01:57.090 --> 02:02.090
<laugh>,

01:58.350 --> 01:59.450
The coach thinks it's good.

01:59.590 --> 01:59.810
So

02:00.590 --> 02:01.130
The hip.

02:01.230 --> 02:01.450
Mm.

02:01.870 --> 02:05.010
And your hip and break is have together.

02:05.150 --> 02:05.370
Mm.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.410
This is the really power.

02:07.550 --> 02:07.770
Mm.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.008
That is the tension.

02:09.100 --> 02:11.250
Power is that is the power.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.050
This is the body power.

02:13.880 --> 02:14.170
That

02:14.170 --> 02:15.930
Is the reason you smash is the hardest.

02:16.110 --> 02:16.330
Mm.

02:16.520 --> 02:21.690
Many people think that it's important to get your elbow like this, but I also found that I can't generate the same power.

02:22.280 --> 02:26.850
That is a playing power is about in of movement.

02:27.160 --> 02:28.970
That is M cross.

02:29.870 --> 02:30.290
Ah, okay.

02:30.360 --> 02:34.130
That means that you longer and your square.

02:34.350 --> 02:34.570
Mm.

02:34.600 --> 02:34.890
Okay.

02:34.890 --> 02:35.730
That is more

02:35.730 --> 02:36.170
Important.

02:36.430 --> 02:37.530
So that is a street.

02:37.720 --> 02:38.010
Okay.

02:38.480 --> 02:39.290
That is a power.

02:39.550 --> 02:40.650
So stretching up higher here.

02:40.680 --> 02:40.970
Yeah.

02:41.070 --> 02:45.770
You more here, you more, less power you, more higher you,

02:46.550 --> 02:46.930
You generate.

02:47.160 --> 02:47.450
Yeah.

02:47.450 --> 02:50.970
That is the reason your heart, that is the power here.

02:51.280 --> 02:53.290
From here to here, really hard.

02:53.800 --> 02:57.170
Plus your finger 30%.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.090
That is enough.

02:58.090 --> 02:58.370
Yeah.

02:58.370 --> 02:59.800
Your, your fingers have to relax.

02:59.970 --> 03:00.320
Relax.

03:00.390 --> 03:01.600
This is the finger power.

03:02.830 --> 03:03.440
It's perfect.

03:04.450 --> 03:05.720
Could you try a little more?

03:05.720 --> 03:06.840
Yeah, I try a few more.

03:25.910 --> 03:29.040
